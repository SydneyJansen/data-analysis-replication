To get your Rmd document to knit and your code to work I had to change line 46 to be a relative path within your repo to your data "data/rawdata.csv" rather than try to pull from GitHub. I also needed to change line 72 to refer to a relative path within your repo to embed the figure. However, this is just a PNG version of a figure that, presumably, you created... it should be the figure from the paper to which you are comparing/trying to replicate (Fig 2a). Similarly, line 209 needs to also be changed to refer to a relative path within your repo to get the figure to embed. Otherwise, this is a solid effort. Couple of comments... First, for your visualization replication, you don't actually graph grand medians and interquartile ranges from the data but rather plot the summary median and upper/lower IQR from bootstrapping from the data... so you're not actually plotting what they report is being plotted in their Fig 2a (here, the "grand medians" are likely calculated as medians of medians of medians, with the first being within series, then within treatment, then within animal. Second, you are presenting the data in SECONDS (even though your axis says milliseconds) while the figure axis in the paper is in milliseconds. Second, for your descriptive stats replication, because you have filtered "data" in line 49 to only include calls where duration was recorded, your code to summarize counts of calls does not count the # of cackles, so your table in this section does not match that provided in Supplementary Data. (As you note, most other counts match what is reported.) Minor comments: - line 55: `print(data)` prints the entire data frame. This is unnecessary
